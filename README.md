Welcome to the Outlier UI Developer Challenge.

This repo contains a small UI project written in React. Unfortunately it has many errors and 
outmoded coding practices, particularly in Launches.jsx, the components and the actions. The layout, routing,
stores and services are more up to date, so don't waste too much of your time on them (although
feel free to give feedback or make fixes if you think significant improvements are possible and you want to take 
the time — but they're not necessarily intended to be in scope of the challenge.)

The repo is designed to be simple to start and run with just npm (or yarn) and any recent version of node.
It is built on webpack and uses the webpack development server, so all you should need to do is clone the 
repo and start the app in development mode with npm start and view it on port 7357. All the tools 
for writing tests and code should be included, but feel free to add additional dependencies if you find that
helps you.

While the app is written in React and Redux and basic knowledge of these frameworks may be helpful,
 this is not explicitly a test of your React knowledge, the changes do not
necessarily involve knowledge of the React lifecycle, but rather good front end development practices,
 efficient modern functional and object-oriented Javascript (ES6) as well as CSS or SASS specifically.

Feel free to add files, breakup components or modularize and generally clean up code. Following good
test-driven development, write tests around the classes and objects you change, ie, the actions,
components, and the Launches view as well as any new files you add.

The development challenge is built against the space-x public REST API `https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2025350/RWaEzAiG`

Good Luck.
